## 1. Bioregion Profile

### 1.1 Boundaries and Delineation

Administratively, the Odemira bioregion broadly coincides with the municipality of Odemira in the district of Beja, Alentejo, which covers 1,720.6 km², making it the largest municipality in Portugal by area.[1] The resident population was 29,538 in the 2021 census, rising to about 31,488 by the end of 2022 according to INE‑based series.[2][3]

Ecologically and hydrologically, the bioregion is structured around the Mira River basin, notably the stretch from the Santa Clara dam to the estuary at Vila Nova de Milfontes and the irrigated coastal plain known as the Perímetro de Rega do Mira (Mira Irrigation Perimeter).[4][5] Much of Odemira's coastline and lower Mira valley are within the Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina (PNSACV), a protected area extending 110 km along the southwest coast between São Torpes (near Sines) and Burgau, and including the Mira valley from the river mouth inland to Odemira town.[6]

At the European scale, most of the coastal and lower valley part of Odemira falls inside the Natura 2000 site "Costa Sudoeste" (PTCON0012), which spans ⚠️ 262,298.5 ha [CORRECTION: Actually 118,266.58 ha per EUNIS/EEA data; the 262k figure may be a different zone or error] (62% marine) in the Mediterranean and Marine Atlantic biogeographical regions and protects 110 directive species and 47 habitat types.[7][8] This coastal strip is thus a core piece of a larger bioregional corridor that links Alentejo and Algarve coastal ecosystems.

### 1.2 Geography & Topography

Odemira's territory grades from a rugged, cliffed Atlantic coastline with dune systems and small estuaries into rolling plateaus and dissected hills inland. The PNSACV coastline includes high cliffs, narrow ravines with intermittent or permanent streams, sandy beaches, dune fields and the estuary of the Mira River.[6][9]

Altitudes in the park area range up to about 324 m inland and 156 m on the coastal hills; similar elevations occur on Odemira's inland ridges (e.g., Serra do Cercal).[6] The Mira valley itself forms a low‑lying corridor from Santa Clara reservoir down to the sea, historically important for alluvial agriculture and now for irrigated horticulture.[4]

Topography strongly shapes land use:
- Steeper schist hill slopes inland support montado (cork and holm oak agroforestry), shrubland and extensive grazing.
- Flatter coastal terraces and dune‑backed plains between Vila Nova de Milfontes and Odeceixe host the Mira Irrigation Perimeter, with intensive horticulture and berries under plastic.[4][10]

Municipal planning documents (Plano Diretor Municipal, PDM) and associated "Plantas de Ordenamento e Condicionantes" provide parcel‑scale zoning, slope constraints and protected‑area overlays in GIS format for the entire municipality.[11]

### 1.3 Climate & Hydrology

Odemira has a hot‑summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) with strong Atlantic influence on the coast: mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.[6][12] Modelled climate statistics indicate an annual mean temperature around 18.9 °C, with average summer highs above 30 °C and winter lows around 6–8 °C.[12] Annual rainfall is on the order of 550–600 mm, highly seasonal, with most precipitation in November–February and very dry summers; one source reports roughly 600 mm per year with November and December as the wettest months.[13]

Hydrologically, the Mira River is central. The Aproveitamento Hidroagrícola do Mira, built between 1963 and 1973, serves a 15,200 ha equipped area with about 12,000 ha effectively benefited by irrigation.[4] Water is diverted from the Santa Clara dam on the Mira via a 38 km main canal and a network of secondary and tertiary canals totalling nearly 600 km, supplying irrigated agriculture, urban areas, industry and aquaculture along ~41 km of coastal strip between Vila Nova de Milfontes and Rogil.[4]

However, hydrological stress has become acute. In recent years, storage in the Mira basin has dropped to around 36–37% of capacity versus historical averages near 76–80%, with activists reporting sections of the Mira running with virtually no flow between Santa Clara and the estuary.[5][10] Citizen movements (Juntos pelo Sudoeste, SOS Rio Mira) and the municipality have flagged risks to both public water supply and the irrigation perimeter, prompting negotiations on a "pacto da água" among the municipality, APA, the regional agriculture directorate and the Beneficiaries' Association of Mira.[5][14]

[ADDITION: In 2023, the Ministry of Agriculture removed ABM's management of the irrigation perimeter due to conflicts over water allocation between farmers and public supply. APA now manages water directly.][15]

Climate projections for Alentejo as a whole indicate increasing temperatures, more frequent and intense droughts and higher wildfire risk, exacerbating Odemira's already strong summer aridity and placing added pressure on the Mira system and rain‑fed montado landscapes.[10]

### 1.4 Soils & Geology

Geologically, the coastal PNSACV strip showcases Carboniferous, Triassic and Jurassic formations along the cliffs, overlain in many places by Quaternary beach deposits, fluvial terraces and dune systems with sandy to sandy‑clayey substrates.[9] North and south of the main lithified cliffs, extensive sandy and sandy‑clayey coastal plains support both natural dune vegetation and agricultural conversion.[9]

Inland, schist and grauvacke bedrock forms rolling, erosion‑prone slopes with generally shallow, low‑fertility soils. These conditions have favoured extensive agro‑silvo‑pastoral systems (montado) where tree cover, ground vegetation and low‑intensity grazing help stabilise soils and regulate runoff.[16][17]

Although municipality‑scale soil maps are not easily accessible online, national land‑cover statistics from CORINE and ForestSTATS show that "agro‑forestry systems" and "heterogeneous agricultural areas" occupy substantial shares of southern Portugal, with agro‑forestry expanding from about 629,000 ha in 2000 to over 770,000 ha by 2018 at national scale.[18][19] Odemira's mosaics of montado, pastures and mixed crops fit this pattern, while coastal irrigation schemes overlay lighter sandy soils prone to wind erosion and saltwater intrusion if poorly managed.

Data gaps: high‑resolution soil maps (texture, depth, organic matter, salinity) and erosion‑risk maps for Odemira specifically are not readily available in open sources; targeted pedological surveys and LIDAR‑based erosion modelling would significantly strengthen land‑suitability and restoration planning.

## 2. Ecology

### 2.1 Ecosystems & Habitats

Odemira's bioregion spans a particularly rich gradient of ecosystems:
- **Coastal cliffs and dunes:** The PNSACV's cliffs, ravines, beaches and dune systems hold a rare, still largely natural Mediterranean coastal landscape with high habitat diversity, including cliff‑top scrub, dune grasslands, saline steppes and rocky intertidal zones.[9][6]
- **Riverine and estuarine systems:** The Mira estuary, lower river, and riparian corridors host wetlands, tidal flats, saltmarshes and riparian forests that act as nurseries for fish and feeding/resting areas for migratory birds.[6][20]
- **Montado (cork/holm oak agroforestry):** Inland plateaus and hills are dominated by montado—semi‑natural oak woodlands with understory pastures and crops, a man‑made but biodiversity‑rich ecosystem emblematic of Alentejo.[16][17]
- **Shrublands and heathlands:** On poorer or abandoned soils, extensive shrub mosaics provide habitat for Mediterranean flora and fauna, often interspersed with patches of pine or eucalyptus plantations.
- **Agricultural mosaics:** Dryland cereals, olive groves, small vineyards and orchards, and increasing areas of irrigated horticulture and berry plantations under plastic, especially within the Mira irrigation perimeter.[4][10]

The Natura 2000 site "Costa Sudoeste" (PTCON0012) includes 47 Habitats Directive habitat types across marine and terrestrial zones, indicating a very high habitat diversity within this coastal‑riverine strip.[7][8]

### 2.2 Flora & Fauna Inventories

Botanical inventories for the PNSACV area record about 750 plant species, including at least 12 worldwide endemics concentrated on coastal cliffs and dunes.[9] These communities include endemic Armeria and Astragalus species adapted to salt spray and wind, as well as diverse shrub and heath assemblages.[9]

Avifauna is particularly notable: the park hosts around 200 bird species, with about 26 breeding on the cliffs, including seabirds, raptors and cliff‑nesting passerines.[9] The coastal zone also provides critical stopover and wintering habitat for Palearctic migratory birds that use riparian galleries and estuaries for feeding and rest.[20]

Mammals recorded in the broader Costa Sudoeste area include otter (Lutra lutra) along the entire coast, as well as mustelids, genets, mongooses and wildcats in inland habitats.[9] Montado and associated mosaics support a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates—national studies estimate nearly 400 vertebrate species and around 140 aromatic/medicinal plants in montado landscapes, underlining their biodiversity value, though exact counts for Odemira's share are not disaggregated.[17]

Marine and coastal biodiversity is exceptionally rich. A synthetic review of marine biodiversity within the PNSACV reports 1,889 species recorded, with at least 38 species having some conservation status and at least 17 classified as non‑indigenous.[21] New habitats of conservation interest (e.g., gorgonian "gardens" and deep sponge aggregations) have been identified within or near the park area.[21]

### 2.3 Endangered & Protected Species

The Natura 2000 Costa Sudoeste site (PTCON0012) protects 110 species under the Birds and Habitats Directives across its area, including priority plants, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds.[7] While site‑specific species lists are extensive, key protected components relevant to Odemira include:
- Cliff‑breeding raptors and seabirds.
- Mediterranean and endemic cliff/dune flora with narrow ranges.
- Otter and other mammals dependent on intact coastal and riverine habitats.[9][20][7]

In montado systems, cork oak (Quercus suber) itself is not endangered but is legally protected and ecologically central; Portugal holds about 720,000 ha of cork oak, most in Alentejo, and the species has been legally protected since at least the 16th century.[22] Montado is recognised as a priority habitat (Habitat 6310 "Evergreen Quercus spp. dehesas/montados") under Natura 2000.[17]

### 2.4 Ecological Processes & Dynamics

Key ecological dynamics include:
- **Fire regimes:** Montado systems, with dispersed trees and grazed understory, have historically helped reduce large fire risk compared to dense conifer plantations, though climate‑driven aridity and land abandonment increase vulnerability.[16][17]
- **Hydrological connectivity:** River corridors (Mira and tributaries) and small coastal streams provide key connectivity for fish, amphibians, mammals and migratory birds; water abstraction and reduced flows are altering these processes.[20][5]
- **Soil and dune dynamics:** Coastal dunes and cliffs are shaped by wind and wave action; vegetation stabilises dunes and buffers erosion. Intensive agriculture, infrastructure and tourism can destabilise these systems.
- **Agro‑ecological dynamics in montado:** Traditional extensive grazing and low‑input agroforestry practices maintain open woodland structure and high biodiversity; intensification, overgrazing or abandonment can reduce diversity and resilience.[16][23]

## 3. Land Use

### 3.1 Historical Land Use & Trajectories

Historically, Odemira, like much of Alentejo, was characterised by extensive dryland cereals, olive groves, pastoralism and large estates with montado systems combining cork/holm oaks, pasture and occasional crops.[16][23] National analyses of land‑use change show significant declines in forest cover and arable land during the 20th century, with expansion of mixed and agro‑forestry systems and shrublands.[24]

The construction of the Mira irrigation scheme (1960s–1970s) marked a turning point, converting parts of previously marginal "Charneca de Odemira" into irrigated land suitable for horticulture.[4] Over recent decades, especially since the 2000s, irrigated horticulture and berry production (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries) in greenhouses or under plastic tunnels have expanded rapidly within the perimeter, overlapping with the PNSACV protected area.[4][25]

### 3.2 Current Land Use Patterns

Current land‑use patterns can be summarised as:
- **Inland and upland areas:** Dominated by montado (cork/holm oak agroforestry), shrublands, pastures and some eucalyptus or pine plantations. These support extensive livestock, cork production and hunting.[16][17]
- **Coastal irrigation zone (Perímetro de Rega do Mira):** Approximately 12,000 ha of benefited land with dense mosaic of intensive horticulture, berry plantations and ornamental plants, much of it under greenhouses or tunnels.[4][10]
- **Urban/tourism nodes:** Vila Nova de Milfontes, Zambujeira do Mar, Almograve, Odemira town and São Teotónio, with associated tourism infrastructure along the coast and valley.[6][2]
- **Protected natural areas:** Large swathes of coastal and riparian land inside PNSACV and Natura 2000 sites, with restrictions on certain types of development.[26][7]

Citizen‑collected data reported by Juntos pelo Sudoeste indicate that between 2013 and 2021 the area of covered crops (mainly greenhouses) in the region almost tripled from 438 to ⚠️ 1,576 ha [CORRECTION: Recent satellite data shows 1,253 ha in 2021, though expansion continues toward the 4,800 ha limit], reflecting rapid intensification.[5] Government resolutions governing the Mira perimeter have allowed up to 40% of the 12,000 ha irrigation area (c. 4,800 ha) to be covered with greenhouses and plastic tunnels, compared to previous ceilings near 80%, but still permitting a potential tripling of the existing covered area.[27][25][28]

### 3.3 Zoning & Planning

The municipality's PDM is the core legal instrument for land‑use zoning, establishing categories such as urban, urbanizable, rural/agricultural, forest and protected areas, and defining building indices, minimum parcel sizes and conditions for land‑use change.[11][29] Coastal zones and areas within PNSACV are subject to additional constraints derived from national special‑planning instruments, now transposed into municipal plans.[11]

Recent amendments to urban plans (e.g., Almograve urbanization plan) explicitly reference the need to align with updated PDM rules and national territory‑management regimes when transforming land use.[30] Within the irrigation perimeter, a special regime (RCM 179/2019) sets specific rules for greenhouse coverage, water use and worker accommodation, though this regime has been strongly contested by local movements for enabling excessive intensification in a protected area.[25][31][28]

### 3.4 Pressures & Trends

Major land‑use pressures include:
- **Agricultural intensification:** Rapid expansion of plastic greenhouses and tunnels for berries and other high‑value crops in the Mira perimeter, with associated water use, pesticide/fertiliser inputs and landscape fragmentation.[27][10][32]
- **Water‑driven land‑use conflict:** Scarcity at Santa Clara reservoir has led to rationing of water for irrigation and possible exclusion of "precário" small users, while large farms lobby for high allocations; traditional wells are reported to be drying, and uncontrolled borehole drilling affects aquifers.[14][10][5]
- **Tourism and coastal development:** Growth in accommodation, roads and services along the coast exerts cumulative pressure on dunes, cliffs and estuaries, though still moderated by park regulations.[6][26]
- **Land abandonment and shrub encroachment:** In some inland parishes with demographic decline, abandonment of small agriculture can lead to shrub expansion, altered fire regimes and loss of traditional mosaic landscapes.[2][24]

## 4. Cultural

### 4.1 Historical Overview

Odemira's human history mirrors broader southwest Iberian trajectories: prehistoric occupation, Roman and later medieval settlement, and gradually consolidated agrarian estates in the early modern period. The montado landscape itself is the product of centuries of human management that progressively transformed Mediterranean woodland into an agro‑silvo‑pastoral system centred on cork and holm oaks.[17][23]

By the 20th century, large estates and extensive land uses dominated, with low population densities and limited industrialisation. The mid‑century construction of the Mira irrigation scheme and later the designation of PNSACV added new layers of agrarian modernization and environmental regulation.[4][6] Since the 1990s–2000s, integration into EU agricultural markets has driven a shift toward export‑oriented horticulture and berries, reshaping demographic and social patterns.

### 4.2 Communities & Demographics

Odemira's population has grown modestly, from about 26,066 in 2011 to 29,538 in 2021, with significant variation among parishes: coastal and irrigation‑zone parishes like São Teotónio and Vila Nova de Milfontes have grown strongly, while some inland parishes have declined.[2]

Demographic structure is strikingly shaped by migration. In 2021, of 29,538 residents, 5,623 were born in Asia & Oceania (vs 20,946 in Portugal), and 5,787 residents held Asian & Oceania citizenship; these numbers exceed those from Africa or the Americas, indicating a large South and Southeast Asian migrant workforce, especially in agriculture.[2] This aligns with national reports of more than 10,000 migrant workers employed in Portugal's berry industry, with Odemira as a key hub.[33]

Age structure is relatively young for a rural Portuguese municipality, with 22,699 residents aged 15–64 and 7,538 aged 65+ (2024 estimates), reflecting the influx of working‑age migrants.[2] However, many older Portuguese residents remain in inland villages experiencing service decline and social fragmentation.

### 4.3 Traditions & Cultural Landscapes

Alentejo culture is deeply expressed in Odemira's montado landscapes, traditional pastoralism, cork harvesting, and rural architecture (whitewashed villages, montes, stone terraces).[16][34] Montado constitutes both an ecological and cultural landscape—cork oak forests have been managed for cork, acorns and grazing for centuries and are celebrated in regional identity, music and cuisine.[16][17][23]

Coastal fishing communities and agricultural villages have their own traditions linked to the sea, river and seasonal work cycles. Cultural landscapes in the PNSACV—such as terraced fields overlooking cliffs, old irrigation channels and small-scale orchards—coexist uneasily with large export‑oriented farms and greenhouses.

Festivals and local events (not detailed in the sources used) generally follow Alentejo patterns of religious and seasonal calendars, often symbolically tied to harvests, cork stripping and transhumance, though more research would be needed to document them specifically for Odemira.

### 4.4 Local Knowledge Systems

Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) persists among older farmers and shepherds in relation to:
- Water harvesting (cisterns, wells) and careful use of scarce rainfall.
- Grazing regimes that avoid overuse of fragile soils.
- Fire use and avoidance in montado systems, with practices that historically limited catastrophic burns.[16][17]

However, much of the new intensive agriculture is driven by external capital and agronomic models with limited integration of local TEK. Citizen movements and regenerative initiatives (see Section 8) can be seen as attempts to articulate new local knowledge systems that blend tradition with agroecology and restoration science.

## 5. Land Intelligence

### 5.1 GIS Layers & Spatial Datasets

Key spatial datasets relevant to the Odemira bioregion include:
- **Land cover / land use:** CORINE Land Cover (CLC) datasets (1990–2018) from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, providing 44 land‑cover classes and change layers for Portugal; though not municipality‑specific in summaries, raw GIS layers can be clipped to Odemira.[19][18]
- **Protected areas:** Natura 2000 site PTCON0012 "Costa Sudoeste" (Standard Data Form and EEA map viewer), including boundaries, habitat and species tables.[7]
  - PNSACV boundary and internal zoning from ICNF and the park's management plan (Plano de Ordenamento do PNSACV).[35][36]
- **Administrative and planning boundaries:** Odemira PDM "Plantas de Ordenamento e Condicionantes" and related urban plans in GIS/PDF formats on the municipal geoportal.[11][37]
- **Hydrology and irrigation infrastructure:** ABM technical information on the Mira Irrigation Perimeter: perimeter boundaries, canal network, reservoir locations and equipped/benefited areas.[4]
  - Municipal hydrography map for Odemira, including rivers and streams.[38]
- **Elevation and terrain:** EU‑DEM and national DEMs (not referenced directly in the sources, but accessible via Copernicus and DGT), enabling slope and aspect mapping.

These datasets support analyses of land‑cover change, habitat fragmentation, zoning conflicts and suitability mapping for regenerative practices.

### 5.2 Remote Sensing & Land‑Cover Change

While no single comprehensive remote‑sensing study for Odemira was found in the search, several strands of evidence can be integrated:
- National CORINE change statistics show shifts from forest to agro‑forestry and heterogeneous agricultural categories, consistent with expansion of montado and mosaics relative to pure forest.[18][24]
- Local activist analyses and media reporting indicate rapid expansion of greenhouse and plastic‑covered crops in the Mira perimeter over the last decade, corroborated by citizen estimates of covered area almost tripling between 2013 and 2021.[5][25][31] These trends are visible in satellite imagery (Sentinel‑2, Landsat) as bright plastic rectangles overlaying former fields and shrubland.
- Articles on water crisis in the Mira system describe a period after 2014 in which water consumption per hectare in the perimeter rose sharply, linked to high‑density greenhouse production, suggesting intensification of irrigated land‑use practices even when nominal irrigated area remained similar.[39][10]

More systematic remote‑sensing work—e.g., classification of plastic greenhouses, time‑series of NDVI or evapotranspiration, and coastline erosion mapping—could be undertaken using Copernicus and Landsat data, but is beyond what is directly documented in available sources.

### 5.3 Socioeconomic & Ownership Data

Municipality‑level statistics from INE and summarised by portals such as CityPopulation provide demographic and (elsewhere) economic data, but fine‑scale land ownership and tenure data are not openly accessible.[2][40] Nonetheless, the pattern described in multiple sources is:
- Large agro‑industrial enterprises (often foreign capital) lease or own significant tracts in the irrigation perimeter to produce export berries and ornamentals.
- Many small Portuguese landowners and "precário" users rely on limited water allocations or are outside the main network.[14][25]
- Thousands of migrant workers, primarily from South Asia, live in precarious housing (including container "cities") often on or adjacent to agricultural land.[33][28][25]

Municipality‑wide sectoral breakdowns are not detailed in the sources used, but one article notes that industrial‑scale agriculture now represents over 60% of local economic activity in parts of the coastal strip, overshadowing other rural economies.[10]

### 5.4 Tools & Platforms

Relevant tools and platforms for land intelligence in Odemira include:
- **Natura 2000 map viewer:** Visualisation and query tool for PTCON0012 and other protected areas, including species/habitat layers.[7]
- **Copernicus Land Monitoring Service:** Downloadable CLC and high‑resolution layers that can be used to quantify land‑cover categories and changes at municipal and sub‑municipal scales.[18][19]
- **Odemira municipal portal:** Access to PDM regulation, zoning maps, urban plans and regulatory documents relevant for spatial planning and development control.[11][37]
- **ICNF portals:** Park management plan documents, protected‑areas maps and biodiversity syntheses for PNSACV.[35][36][20]
- **Climate data services:** Sites such as Meteoblue and NearWeather provide downscaled climate normals and historical simulations for Odemira, useful for local climate characterisation and impact studies.[12][41][13]

---

## 6. Planning & Management

### 6.1 Governance & Institutions

Key institutions for land and environmental governance in Odemira include:
- **Municipality of Odemira:** Responsible for local spatial planning (PDM, urban and detail plans), local infrastructure, and implementation of many environmental and climate initiatives.[11][42]
- **ICNF (Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas):** Manages the PNSACV as part of the national protected‑areas network, including park zoning, conservation measures and co‑management arrangements with municipalities.[35][36][26]
- **APA (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente):** Oversees water resources (including Santa Clara reservoir and the Mira basin), environmental licensing and EIA processes.[5][14]
- **Associação de Beneficiários do Mira (ABM):** ⚠️ [NOTE: ABM was removed from irrigation management in 2023; APA now manages water directly. Historical reference only.] Manages irrigation infrastructure and water distribution in the Mira Irrigation Perimeter.[4]
- **Regional and national bodies:** DGT (territory), agriculture directorates, regional development commissions (CCDR Alentejo), which influence regional planning, CAP implementation and environmental enforcement.[11][28]

Co‑management models for protected areas were reinforced by DL 116/2019 and DL 63/2023, giving municipalities a more formal role in protected‑area governance; PNSACV is explicitly under such a co‑management framework, involving Odemira and neighbouring municipalities plus higher‑education and civil‑society entities.[26]

### 6.2 Policies & Regulations

Several policy regimes intersect in the Odemira bioregion:
- **EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP):** Subsidies and rural‑development programmes shape farm practices, including support for permanent crops, montado, and (indirectly) intensive horticulture.
- **Natura 2000 / Habitats and Birds Directives:** Legal obligations to maintain and restore favourable conservation status of habitats and species within PTCON0012 and associated SPAs, constraining certain types of development and land‑use change.[7][8]
- **Water framework and related directives:** EU and national law require good ecological status of water bodies, influencing Mira basin management and limits on abstraction and pollution.
- **National planning framework and RJIGT:** The RJIGT sets national rules for territorial planning and mandates PDMs as core municipal instruments.[11]

A particularly contentious regulation is the 2019 Council of Ministers Resolution (RCM 179/2019), which created a special transitional regime for the Mira Irrigation Perimeter within PNSACV. It allows plastic‑covered agriculture to expand up to 40% of the 12,000 ha perimeter (about 4,800 ha), up from existing estimates of around 1,600 ha (11%), and authorises large on‑farm container settlements for up to 36,000 additional workers.[25][28][31] Citizen movements and local officials have criticised this as incompatible with protected‑area goals and local carrying capacity.[25][43][10]

### 6.3 Protected & Conservation Areas

The core conservation designations relevant to Odemira include:
- **Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina (PNSACV):**
  - Created in 1995 (after being a Protected Landscape since 1988); current area ⚠️ about 89,572 ha (60,577 ha terrestrial, 28,992 ha marine) [CORRECTION: Recent ICNF data indicates 60,567 ha terrestrial + 28,858 ha marine = 89,425 ha total], spanning Sines, Odemira, Aljezur and Vila do Bispo.[26][6]
  - Objectives include rational management of natural, landscape and socio‑economic resources, and safeguarding of coastal and riverine ecosystems.[26][9]
- **Natura 2000 site PTCON0012 "Costa Sudoeste":**
  - ⚠️ 262,298.5 ha (62% marine) [CORRECTION: 118,266.58 ha per EUNIS/EEA], protecting 47 habitats and 110 directive species in Mediterranean and Marine Atlantic biogeographical regions.[7][8]
  - Overlaps strongly with PNSACV and extends into offshore marine areas.
- **Associated SPAs and national designations:**
  - ZPE (Special Protection Zone) Costa Sudoeste, covering much of the same area with emphasis on bird conservation.[26][8]

Park and Natura 2000 regulations impose constraints on construction, agricultural intensification and resource extraction, but their enforcement and interpretation in the context of the irrigation perimeter remain contentious.[31][10]

### 6.4 Restoration & Sustainable Land Management Projects

Several types of regenerative or sustainable projects operate in Odemira:
- **Marine biodiversity and conservation projects:** The MARSW project is synthesising and mapping marine biodiversity across PNSACV, including identification of OSPAR habitats and monitoring community changes.[21]
- **Regenerative agriculture and eco‑farms:**
  - A Quinta da Lage, a regenerative eco‑farm in the coastal natural park, applies keyline design, holistic grazing, agroforestry and soil restoration, and runs educational courses on land restoration and local food systems.[44]
- **Bioregional/regenerative platforms:**
  - Regenerativa – Cooperativa Integral, based in São Luís (Odemira), acts as a platform for ecological, economic, social and cultural regeneration, supporting agroforestry regeneration, non‑formal education and cultural projects, and coordinating a local food system that connects producers and consumers.[45][46]

In addition, the municipality is engaged in climate and sustainability planning through European projects such as the Phoenix Horizon pilot, which aims to co‑create a local Agenda 2030‑aligned climate and sustainability action plan with community participation.[47][42]

Data gaps: many local restoration activities (small farm projects, community gardens, river‑cleanup initiatives) are not systematically documented in accessible databases; creating a local "restoration registry" would support coordination and learning.

## 7. Threats & Resilience

### 7.1 Climate Change Impacts

Climate projections for Alentejo consistently show:
- Rising temperatures and more frequent heatwaves.
- Decreasing and more variable rainfall, with longer and more intense droughts.
- Increased evapotranspiration and fire risk.[10]

In Odemira, these trends are already intersecting with:
- Water scarcity in the Mira basin (reservoir levels around half historical averages; repeated drought years since 2011).[5][10]
- Stress on rain‑fed montado systems, where water scarcity and soil degradation can reduce tree vitality and pasture productivity, undermining both biodiversity and rural livelihoods.[17][16]
- Elevated wildfire risk on shrub‑encroached and plantation areas, especially where traditional grazing and cork‑harvesting regimes have been disrupted.

Marine and coastal systems face additional risks from sea‑level rise, coastal erosion and warming, threatening dunes, cliffs, intertidal communities and fisheries, though site‑specific projections are not detailed in the sources used.[21][6]

### 7.2 Water Scarcity & Hydrological Stress

Water scarcity is perhaps the most acute and visible threat:
- Storage in Santa Clara reservoir and the Mira basin has fallen to around 36–37% of capacity in recent low‑rainfall years, compared to historical averages near 76–80%.[5][10]
- Sections of the Mira between the dam and the estuary have been reported as having no surface flow at times, which activists describe as ecological "agony".[5]
- The Beneficiaries' Association of Mira has begun rationing water; 100–150 small property owners classified as "precários" risk losing access, while quotas for other farmers are being cut.[14]
- Traditional wells are reported to be drying up, and numerous unregulated boreholes are suspected of contributing to aquifer depletion.[14][10]

At the same time, greenhouse‑based horticulture has driven an increase in per‑hectare water consumption since around 2014, according to investigative analysis of water use and Santa Clara levels, indicating intensification of water‑demanding crops even as supplies shrink.[39][10]

### 7.3 Other Environmental Threats

Other key threats include:
- **Intensive agriculture and pollution:** Heavy use of plastics, agrochemicals and intensive soil cultivation in the irrigation perimeter threatens soils, nearby habitats and water quality; citizen movements describe a "mar de plástico" (sea of plastic) along ~40 km of coast.[27][10][32]
- **Habitat fragmentation and landscape homogenisation:** Large greenhouse blocks, road infrastructure and container settlements fragment habitats and alter landscape character within the protected area.[31][28]
- **Invasive species:** The marine synthesis report identified at least 17 non‑indigenous marine species in PNSACV waters, underscoring bio‑invasion risks in coastal ecosystems.[21]
- **Social and cultural erosion:** Rapid demographic change, precarious labour conditions and overload of local services (schools, health, social security) strain social cohesion and capacity to participate in governance.[25][33][28]

### 7.4 Adaptation & Resilience Strategies

Emerging responses include:
- **Water governance efforts:** Negotiation of a "pacto da água" among Odemira municipality, APA, agricultural authorities and ABM to balance public supply, irrigation and ecological needs; rationing of irrigation quotas by ABM.[5][14]
- **Policy debates on limiting greenhouses:** Calls from political parties (e.g., Bloco de Esquerda) and citizen movements for a moratorium on new greenhouses ("nem mais um metro de estufa") and for public control of Mira water management.[48][31][25]
- **Protected‑area co‑management:** New co‑management structures for PNSACV aim to strengthen municipal and civil‑society involvement in park decisions, though their effectiveness remains to be evaluated.[26]
- **Local climate‑action planning:** Odemira's involvement in EU projects (e.g., Phoenix Horizon) seeks to create participatory climate‑action agendas integrating land, transport, agriculture and environment.[47]
- **Nature‑based solutions and regenerative agriculture:** Regenerative farms and cooperatives (e.g., A Quinta da Lage, Regenerativa) implement practices such as keyline water management, agroforestry, holistic grazing and community food systems, enhancing soil water‑holding capacity, biodiversity and local food resilience.[44][45][46]

Quantitative metrics (e.g., reduction in greenhouse area, improved reservoir storage, biodiversity recovery) are not yet systematically available; establishing a monitoring framework with indicators on water use, land‑cover change, soil health and species trends would be essential to track adaptation success.

## 8. Community

### 8.1 Case Studies

Several community‑driven or regenerative case studies illustrate alternative trajectories:

**Regenerativa – Cooperativa Integral (São Luís):**
- A cooperative platform founded in 2022, emerging from local movements since 2020, dedicated to ecological, economic, social and cultural regeneration of the territory.[45][46]
- Hosts projects like the "Odemira Local Food System" (short supply chains connecting producers and consumers), a "Web of Entrepreneurs" network, and Espaço Nativa (a multi‑use space with grocery, café, events, coworking and catering) that valorises local production and reduces waste.[45]
- Involves around 180 collaborators and about 30 entrepreneurial initiatives in agroforestry regeneration, non‑formal education and culture, forming an ecosystem for regenerative rural development.[45]

**A Quinta da Lage (coastal natural park):**
- A regenerative eco‑farm in the coastal park applying water harvesting, keyline design, holistic grazing, agroforestry and no‑till gardening to restore land and soils.[44]
- Functions as an educational hub offering courses and workshops on regenerative agriculture, eco‑construction, landscape restoration and local food security, explicitly aiming to demonstrate practical pathways to reverse soil erosion and desertification.[44]

**Regenerar Odemira – Regeneration Rural CAMP (São Luís):**
- A scholarship‑funded 2‑week volunteer programme supported by the European Solidarity Corps and Odemira municipality, inviting young people to live in São Luís and collaborate on territory‑care tasks, community gardens and land‑art interventions.[49]
- Inspired by the municipal Local Food System and Regenerativa, it uses hands‑on agroecology and community projects as a learning vehicle for rural futures and territorial care.[49]

These initiatives operate as "living labs" where land, culture and community are explicitly linked in regenerative practice.

### 8.2 Citizen Science & Participatory Monitoring

While no formal citizen‑science water‑quality network akin to some national examples was identified specifically for Odemira, local movements function as de facto monitoring and advocacy networks:
- **Juntos pelo Sudoeste (JPS):** A citizen movement of Odemira and Aljezur residents defending the southwest, which has collected data on greenhouse area and rainfall trends, and uses these to argue for tighter controls on intensive agriculture.[5][25][43]
- **SOS Rio Mira:** Works alongside JPS to highlight ecological degradation and water scarcity in the Mira, organising public alerts and likely contributing to informal monitoring.[5][10]

These groups have submitted petitions to parliament, complaints to the EU and public commentaries that compile and interpret official reports and datasets, effectively democratising environmental information.[25][31][28]

There is an opportunity to formalise such activities into structured citizen‑science programmes (e.g., standardized river health monitoring, biodiversity transects, plastic‑waste mapping) linked to municipal and ICNF databases.

### 8.3 Stakeholder Landscape

Key stakeholder groups in the Odemira bioregion include:
- Small and medium local farmers and landowners (both irrigated and rain‑fed).
- Large agro‑industrial enterprises operating greenhouses and intensive horticulture.
- Thousands of migrant agricultural workers (mainly from South Asia), often living in precarious housing and facing exploitative conditions.[33][25][28]
- Environmental NGOs and citizen movements (JPS, SOS Rio Mira and others).
- Municipal government, ICNF, APA, ABM and regional authorities.
- Tourism actors (accommodation providers, outdoor recreation businesses).
- Regenerative and agroecological initiatives and cooperatives (Regenerativa, regenerative farms, etc.).[45][44][46]

Interests are often conflicting: industrial agriculture prioritises water allocation and regulatory flexibility; local residents and environmental groups prioritise water security, landscape integrity and biodiversity; migrant workers seek rights, security and fair labour conditions; regenerative actors push for systemic shifts. Mapping these stakeholders and their power relations is crucial for designing just and effective bioregional governance.

### 8.4 Collaboration Resources & Future Visions

Emerging collaboration and visioning resources include:
- **Municipal strategic initiatives:** The Plano Estratégico e Operacional de Valorização do Rio Mira seeks to enhance the river's ecological and socio‑economic value, potentially providing a framework for integrated catchment management and restoration, though detailed content is not fully visible in the sources consulted.[42]
- **EU‑funded climate and sustainability projects:** The Phoenix Horizon pilot in Odemira aims to co‑produce a local climate‑action and sustainability agenda with broad stakeholder participation, aligning municipal strategy with Agenda 2030.[47]
- **Bioregional cooperatives and networks:** Regenerativa and associated projects explicitly frame their work as territorial regeneration, fostering a culture of collaboration across ecological, social and economic dimensions.[45][46]

At the same time, citizen petitions such as "O Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina não aguenta mais agricultura intensiva!" articulate a stark warning: the current trajectory of water‑intensive, plastic‑driven export agriculture within a protected coastal bioregion is seen by many inhabitants as ecologically and socially unsustainable.[28][25][10]
